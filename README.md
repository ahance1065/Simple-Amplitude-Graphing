# Simple-Waveform-Graphing

This can be used to compare certain features of a song. For example, 
if you want to re-create the drums from scratch, you can download the drum audio file from an 
instrument extractor, and then import the file here to compare the waveforms to your drum samples.
(most DAWs/Editors have these waveforms).

I am working on creating a version with a file upload button. This current one relies on the Kaggle database feature.
