# Simple-Waveform-Graphing

This can be used to compare certain features of a song. For example, 
if you wanted to re-create the drums from scratch, you can download the drum audio file from an 
instrument extractor, then import the file here to compare the waveforms to your own drum samples.
(most DAWs/Editors have these waveforms).
