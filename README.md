# Simple-Waveform-Graphing

This simple waveform graph can be used to visualize the amplitude/level changes over time or compare certain features of a song. 

For example, if you want to re-create the drums from scratch, you can download the drum audio file from an 
instrument extractor, and then import the file here to compare the waveforms to your drum samples (The pitch may still need tweaking, but you can get close).
Today, most DAWs/Editors have these waveforms.

I am working on creating a version with a file upload button. This current one relies on the Kaggle database feature.
